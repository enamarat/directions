# directions

A small game that I made for my nephew to help him remember the names of different directions. You need to move cursor according to labels that are written in the middle of the screen. If you move the cursor correctly, the side panel under it will turn green; if you move it wrongly, the panel will turn red, and a mistake counter at the top right corner of the screen will increase by one. The goal of the game is to move cursor in right directions without making any mistakes.
